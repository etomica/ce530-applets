<h1>Radial distribution function</h1>
<p>
This applet demonstrates calculation of the radial distribution function (RDF) of the
square-well model system.  Tab between the Configuration and the RDF to observe the
running average of the RDF.  Adjust the slider and hit the "Reset RDF" button
to begin averaging at a different temperature.  Note the strong discontinuity in the
RDF (particularly at low temperature) at separations equal to the well diameter.
</p>
<p>
Well depth is 300 K.  Hard-core diameter is 3.0 A, and the well diameter is 50% more than this.
