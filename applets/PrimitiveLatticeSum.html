<h1>Primitive Model Lattice Sum</h1>
<p>
This applet demonstrates the convergence of the long-range energy for the Coulombic part
of the primitive model (hard spheres with point charges).
</p>
<p>
Energy is computed by summing the Coulombic interaction of the central image with an increasing
number of image shells.  The graph displays the value of the energy obtained as a function of 
the number of shells.
</p>
Adjust the temperature with the slider, which gives the temperature (in Kelvin) on a base-10
log scale.
