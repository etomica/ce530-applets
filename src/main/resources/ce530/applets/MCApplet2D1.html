This applet demonstrates elementary Monte Carlo integration of a two-dimensional function.  The quantity
integrated is the mean square distance from the origin for points within the enclosed region.
</p><p>
By clicking on the appropriate button, you can evaluate the integral via either the two-dimensional
rectangle rule or by simple Monte Carlo inetgration (no biased sampling).
In either case, the number of quadrature points <em>N</em>used to estimate the 
integral can be varied by changing the value in the box (the largest value accepted is
10000).
</p><p>
The rectangle rule takes the quadrature points from a uniform grid, while the MC integration
proceeds with points sampled at random uniformly over the integration region.
</p><p>
The result of the calculation is displayed, along with the error in the result
After each integration, superposed on the figure are the (x,y)-values used to
perform the quadrature
</p><p>
Repeated pressing of the buttons generates new samples, with different x-values taken to give
new estimates of the integral.
