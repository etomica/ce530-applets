<h1>Direct Integration</h1>
<p>
This applet demonstrates the futility of performing a direct quadrature of a configurational integral.
</p>
<p>
The applet attempts to sample all of configuration space by moving each atom methodically through
the box, as one would do if attempting a multidimensional trapezoid-rule integration.  The progress
bar shows at any time how far the simulation has gone in completing this sampling
</p>
<p>
Adjust the number of atoms in the simulation, and the step size of the quadrature process, using
the text boxes.  Hit the "Slow down" button to get a better picture of what is happening in the
quadrature.
</p>
<p>
The atom in the innermost nested integral (with the most frequently changing position) is colored blue,
while the atom in the outermost integral is colored red.  The other atom colors are something between blue
and red, depending on the location of their integral in the nest.  At the outset all atoms are on top of one
another in the upper left corner.  Bluer atoms are drawn on top of redder ones, so the outermost-integral 
atom (the reddest) becomes visible only when all other atoms have moved ahead.  For integration parameters
only slightly larger than the default values, it may be a long wait for the red atom to emerge.  
</p>
<p>
As you increase the parameter values, note that the time to compute the complete multidimensional integral (100% completion)
very quickly becomes too long to be bear waiting.  For any practical values of these parameters (say 100 atoms and
500 steps/dimension) direct calculation of the complete integral in this manner is absolutely hopeless.

<li>you must hit a return after entering a number in order to have your parameter changes take effect
<li>if the image is distorted upon loading, simply hit the Refresh button on your browser
<li>other problems with the applet are discussed in the text below (scroll down if it is not visible)

<p>
This applet is fragile.  Choosing the integration steps to be nine or greater may cause an error (nothing in the
applet will work until you refresh the browser); this breakage may also occur (but not too often) 
when the number of atoms is changed; just Refresh to fix it.
