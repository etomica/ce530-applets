<p>
Molecular dynamics simulation of hard spheres in a piston-cylinder apparatus.
Adjust the pressure with the horizontal slider;  if the piston goes off screen,
shrink the image with the button.
<p>
Run the system adiabatically, or select from three temperatures.  Press the "Stop piston" to help damp oscillations.  "Reset averages" zeroes the running averages of the temperature and density (last two columns of data table).  Intermittent delay in simulation is caused by the updating of the table.  This will be improved in future revisions.
