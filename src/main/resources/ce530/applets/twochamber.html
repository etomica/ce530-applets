Two systems separated by movable, frictionless wall.  System on left is
hard spheres (pure repulsion), while that on the right is square well.
Both systems contain 20 molecules.  Note how average volume is smaller
(density is higher) for system with attractive interactions.  Both
systems are, by construction, at the same pressure.
