Species-changing wall. 
<p> Display is interactive:  
<ul><li>click and drag with mouse
to move around window and change size (scale) of the display.  
<li>Hold ctrl
key while resizing to change the density of the system.  
<li>Press any
number key on keyboard while cursor is display to change the number of
image shells;
<li>Press 's' key to show scale (relative to original size).
</ul>
<p>
We have found the resizing feature to work only with the Netscape browser.  Strange behavior with Explorer.
